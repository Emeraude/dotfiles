# dotfiles

This repo is a collection of the dotfiles I'm using.  
Note that the file `.gitignore` present in this repo is my global gitignore.

The `.bashrc` file present here has not been updated for a while, since I'm using fish now.

In byobu configuration, pidgin requires some configuration (in the `Message Notification` plugin) to display number of unread messages in status line.

File `70-synatics.conf` must be put in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`.
